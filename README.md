This was completed for my Leaving Certificate Computer Science project where the theme was around Health and Wellbeing. 
I used python to create an emotion detector using a camera which scanned for a face and then read the users facial expression using facebooks pretrained Deepface module and Cv2 to acces the computers camera.
The facial expression was captured and the data was stored into an Excel spreadsheet.
The data was then taken and displayed on a graph using matplotlib.
